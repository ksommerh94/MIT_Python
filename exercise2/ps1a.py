# Assumptions:
# 1. Call the cost of your dream home total_cost.
# 2. Call the portion of the cost needed for a down payment portion_down_payment. For simplicity, assume that portion_down_payment = 0.25 (25%).
# 3. Call the amount that you have saved thus far current_savings. You start with a current savings of $0.
# 4. Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, with an annual return of r (in other words, at the end of each month, you receive an additional current_savings*r/12 funds to put into
# your savings â€“ the 12 is because r is an annual rate). Assume that your investments earn a return of r = 0.04 (4%).
# 5. Assume your annual salary is annual_salary.
# 6. Assume you are going to dedicate a certain amount of your salary each month to saving for the down payment. Call that portion_saved. This variable should be in decimal form (i.e. 0.1 for 10%).
# 7. At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your investment, plus a percentage of your monthly salary (annual salary / 12).

# Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you to save up enough money for a down
# payment. You will want your main variables to be floats, so you should cast user inputs to floats.


# Ask the user to enter the following variables:
# 1. The starting annual salary (annual_salary)
# 2. The portion of salary to be saved (portion_saved)
# 3. The cost of your dream home (total_cost)

# Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you to save up enough money for a down
# payment.
